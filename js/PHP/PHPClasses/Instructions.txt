AURIGMA HTML5/FLASH UPLOADER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The /ImageUploaderPHP/ folder contains HTML5/Flash Uploader PHP files. HTML5/Flash Uploader PHP 
is a collection of classes designed to embed the uploader into a PHP application and to handle 
uploaded data. Using this collection of PHP scripts developers can add HTML5/Flash Uploader on 
a page in a standardized way as an arbitrary PHP object.
	
To add HTML5/Flash Uploader PHP to your web application you just need to perform the following steps:

1. Copy the /ImageUploaderPHP/ folder to an application.
2. Link the Uploader.class.php file to a page which hosts HTML5/Flash Uploader.

	<?php 
		require_once "ImageUploaderPHP/Uploader.class.php";
	?>

3. Create a new instance of the Uploader class. Then configure HTML5/Flash Uploader and call the render() 
method which generates HTML5/Flash Uploader code and writes it into a page.

	<?php
		$uploader = new Uploader("Uploader1");
		//configure HTML5/Flash Uploader
		$uploader->render();
	?>

Note: Call the render() method at the position on a PHP page where you want to insert the HTML5/Flash Uploader.
